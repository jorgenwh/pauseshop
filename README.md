# PauseShop 🛒

Ever paused Netflix and thought "I NEED that lamp"? We got you covered! 🛋️✨

PauseShop is a Chrome extension that turns your streaming addiction into a shopping opportunity. Pause any video, and we'll magically find those products on Amazon for you (or hopefully something similar).

## How it works 🪄

1. **Pause** your show (we know you were going to anyway)
2. **Screenshot** gets taken automatically 📸
3. **AI** figures out what stuff is in the scene 🤖
4. **Amazon** search results appear like magic ✨
5. **Shop** till you drop (or until you resume the show)

## What it supports 📺

- Netflix
- Hulu  
- Prime Video
- Disney+
- HBO Max

Basically everywhere you procrastinate.

*Disclaimer: We are not responsible for your impulse purchases or explaining to your partner why you bought a $200 throw pillow because you saw it in Bridgerton.*

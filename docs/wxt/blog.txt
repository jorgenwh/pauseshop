# Introducing `#imports`

[![](https://github.com/aklinker1.png?size=96)Aaron Klinker](https://github.com/aklinker1)â€¢December 6, 2024

WXT v0.20 introduced a new way of manually importing its APIs: **the `#imports` module**. This module was introduced to simplify import statements and provide more visibility into all the APIs WXT provides.

```ts
import { browser } from 'wxt/browser'; 
import { createShadowRootUi } from 'wxt/utils/content-script-ui/shadow-root'; 
import { defineContentScript } from 'wxt/utils/define-content-script'; 
import { injectScript } from 'wxt/utils/inject-script'; 
import { 
  browser, createShadowRootUi, defineContentScript, injectScript 
} from '#imports'; 
```

The `#imports` module is considered a "virtual module", because the file doesn't actually exist. At build-time, imports are split into individual statements for each API:

:::code-group

```ts [What you write]
import { defineContentScript, injectScript } from '#imports';
```

```ts [What the bundler sees]
import { defineContentScript } from 'wxt/utils/define-content-script';
import { injectScript } from 'wxt/utils/inject-script';
```

:::

Think of `#imports` as a convenient way to access all of WXT's APIs from one place, without impacting performance or bundle size.

This enables better tree-shaking compared to v0.19 and below.

## Mocking [â€‹](#mocking)

When writing tests, you might need to mock APIs from the `#imports` module. While mocking these APIs is very easy, it may not be immediately clear how to accomplish it.

Let's look at an example using Vitest. When [configured with wxt/testing](/guide/essentials/unit-testing.html#vitest), Vitest sees the same transformed code as the bundler. That means to mock an API from `#imports`, you need to call `vi.mock` with the real import path, not `#imports`:

```ts
import { injectScript } from '#imports';
import { vi } from 'vitest';

vi.mock('wxt/utils/inject-script')
const injectScriptMock = vi.mocked(injectScript);

injectScriptMock.mockReturnValueOnce(...);
```

## Conclusion [â€‹](#conclusion)

You don't have to use `#imports` if you don't like - you can continue importing APIs from their submodules. However, using `#imports` is the recommended approach moving forwards.

* As more APIs are added, you won't have to memorize additional import paths.
* If breaking changes are made to import paths in future major versions, `#imports` won't break.

Happy Coding ðŸ˜„

> P.S. Yes, this is exactly how [Nuxt's #imports](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports#explicit-imports) works! We use the exact same library, [unimport](https://github.com/unjs/unimport).

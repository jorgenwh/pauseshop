# Streaming Product Analysis Architecture Plan
## True AI Streaming Implementation

## Executive Summary

This plan implements **true AI streaming** by leveraging native streaming capabilities of AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Requesty, OpenRouter). Instead of waiting for complete analysis before displaying results, products will appear in the UI as soon as they are identified by the AI, providing immediate user feedback and significantly improved perceived performance.

## Problem Analysis

### Current Architecture
The existing implementation:
1. **Processes entire image analysis** - Waits for complete AI response
2. **Loads all products at once** - Creates UI for all products from complete JSON
3. **No streaming at service layer** - AI handlers don't support streaming output
4. **Batch display** - All products appear simultaneously after full processing

### Solution: Native AI Streaming
True streaming processes the AI response as it arrives, extracting complete product objects from the partial response and immediately sending them to the frontend as they become available.

## Enhanced Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Native AI Streaming** - Use actual streaming APIs from AI providers
2. **Progressive Product Discovery** - Products appear as AI identifies them
3. **Immediate UI Updates** - Products stream directly to UI as they're found
4. **Consistent JSON Schema** - Maintain existing product structure and validation

### Streaming Flow
```
Image Input → AI Service (Streaming Mode) → Partial Response Processing → 
Extract Complete Products → SSE Events → Frontend Updates → UI Display
```

- **Consistent Layout** - Maintain existing grid and spacing

## Technical Architecture

### Streaming Event Flow
```
1. Image Capture → Extension
2. Streaming Request → Server SSE Endpoint
3. AI Service Selection → Check streaming support
4. Native Streaming Start → AI Provider API
5. Partial Response Processing → Extract complete products
6. SSE Event Emission → Send products to frontend
7. UI Updates → Display products immediately
8. Completion → Standard completion handling
```

### Event Types
- **start** - Analysis initiation (existing)
- **product** - Individual product data (enhanced)
- **complete** - Final results (existing)
- **error** - Error handling (existing)

### Partial Product Extraction

#### Strategy
- **JSON Boundary Detection** - Find complete product objects in partial responses
- **Existing Validation** - Use current product validation logic

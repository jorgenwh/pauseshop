The Motion Library: A Comprehensive Technical Reference for Modern Web Animation
Section 1: The Unified Motion Ecosystem: History, Philosophy, and Architecture
The landscape of web animation libraries is dynamic, with tools evolving to meet the demands of modern development practices and browser capabilities. Motion stands as a prominent, production-ready library designed for creative developers working with JavaScript, React, and Vue. Its architecture and philosophy are the products of a deliberate evolution, merging two distinct yet complementary projects into a single, cohesive ecosystem. A thorough understanding of this history, the library's core principles, and its unique technical architecture is fundamental for any developer seeking to master its capabilities.   

1.1 The Unification: From Framer Motion & Motion One to "Motion"
A primary source of confusion for developers encountering the library is its naming history. The library now known simply as "Motion" is the result of a significant unification of two previously separate projects: Framer Motion and Motion One. This change, which occurred in late 2024, was not merely a rebranding but a reflection of a deeper architectural and philosophical integration.   

Historically, the two libraries served different purposes and developer audiences. Framer Motion was conceived as a declarative, "batteries-included" animation library predominantly for the React ecosystem. It prioritized developer experience (DX) and simplicity, offering a rich, high-level API for creating complex animations with minimal code. In contrast, Motion One was an imperative, lightweight library built as a minimal layer on top of the browser's native Web Animations API (WAAPI). Its core animate() function was remarkably small (around 3.8kb), and its design philosophy centered on maximizing performance and minimizing bundle size by leveraging native browser features wherever possible.   

The unification consolidated these two projects under a single motion package, installable via npm install motion. This unified library provides a single, coherent entry point from which developers can access the full spectrum of animation tools. The powerful, declarative components and hooks that were the hallmark of Framer Motion are now available through framework-specific entry points like motion/react and motion/vue. Simultaneously, the lightweight, high-performance, imperative functions from Motion One are available from the root motion package or specialized endpoints like motion/mini.   

This architectural merge resolves what the library's creator, Matt Perry, described as a "false dichotomy" between the two original libraries. Instead of forcing a choice between a feature-rich declarative library and a minimal imperative one, the unified Motion library presents a spectrum of tools. Developers can now mix and match approaches within the same project, using high-level components for rapid UI development and dropping down to low-level functions for performance-critical animations or framework-agnostic code. This provides a clear and correct mental model for developers: the choice is no longer which library to use, but which API within the unified Motion library is best suited for a given task.   

1.2 Dueling Philosophies: Developer Experience vs. Performance Purity
To make intelligent choices within the unified Motion library, it is crucial to understand the original design goals that shaped its constituent parts. These philosophies continue to influence the API design and represent a fundamental trade-off between developer convenience and raw performance.

The philosophy behind Framer Motion was one of simplicity and "sensible defaults". Its primary goal was to provide the best possible developer experience, abstracting away the complexities of animation. A key feature embodying this principle is its automatic transition generation. When a value like x or scale is animated, the library defaults to a spring physics animation, which feels natural for physical movement. Conversely, when a value like opacity or color is animated, it defaults to a duration-based tween. This "batteries-included" approach means developers can create good-looking, physically plausible animations with very little configuration, enabling rapid prototyping and implementation.   

The philosophy of Motion One, on the other hand, was to be "the jQuery of WAAPI". Its design goal was to push the native Web Animations API beyond its core capabilities while remaining obsessively focused on minimal bundle size. Every feature was designed to be small and, importantly, tree-shakable. For example, to use a spring animation, the spring function must be explicitly imported. This ensures that developers who never use springs do not incur the bundle-size cost associated with that feature. This approach prioritizes performance purity and gives developers granular control over their application's final footprint.   

Within the unified Motion library, this philosophical tension manifests as a spectrum of trade-offs. The choice between using a high-level component like <motion.div> versus the low-level animate() function from motion/mini is a direct decision between convenience and performance. For the vast majority of use cases, particularly within a React or Vue application, the superior developer experience of the declarative API is the recommended path. However, for projects on a strict bundle-size budget, or for performance-critical applications where every kilobyte matters, the ability to use the minimal, imperative API is a powerful option. The reference guide will consistently highlight these trade-offs, empowering developers to make conscious and informed architectural decisions.   

1.3 The Hybrid Engine: WAAPI + JavaScript
Motion's most significant technical differentiator is its unique hybrid animation engine. This engine intelligently combines the performance of native browser APIs with the flexibility and feature-completeness of a custom JavaScript-based engine. This pragmatic approach addresses the inherent limitations and inconsistencies of the current web animation landscape.   

The engine's first priority is to leverage native browser APIs like the Web Animations API (WAAPI) and the ScrollTimeline API whenever possible. This provides two primary benefits:   

Hardware Acceleration: Animations for specific CSS properties—namely transform, opacity, filter, and more recently clipPath—can be handed off to the browser's compositor. This allows the animation to run on a separate thread, often on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), independent of the main JavaScript thread. The practical result is that animations remain perfectly smooth (e.g., at 60 or 120 frames per second) even if the main thread is busy with heavy computations or complex React renders. This is a significant performance advantage over libraries that rely exclusively on JavaScript's requestAnimationFrame loop.   
Smaller Bundle Size: By offloading the complex logic of value interpolation (calculating the "in-between" states of an animation) to the browser, the library itself can be much smaller. The "mini" version of the animate() function is a mere 2.6kb because it relies entirely on the browser's built-in capabilities for interpolation, even between complex value types like px and %, or rgba and hsla.   
However, the WAAPI is not without its limitations and cross-browser inconsistencies. To overcome these, Motion's hybrid engine includes a robust JavaScript fallback engine. This engine, which runs on the requestAnimationFrame loop, enables features that are not natively supported by WAAPI, such as:   

Animating independent transforms (x, y, rotateX, etc.) for greater flexibility, especially in gestures.   
Animating SVG path data for complex path drawing and morphing effects.   
Orchestrating complex, multi-step animation sequences with advanced timing controls.   
Animating arbitrary values in JavaScript objects, which is essential for driving animations in WebGL or other non-DOM environments.   
This hybrid architecture is a pragmatic engineering solution. It uses the best of the native platform for raw performance and efficiency where available, and seamlessly fills in the gaps with a powerful JavaScript engine to provide a complete and consistent feature set. This explains the distinction between the "mini" and "full-featured" versions of the imperative API: the former is a pure-WAAPI wrapper, while the latter includes the JavaScript engine to unlock the full range of capabilities.

Section 2: Core Animation Primitives: Declarative vs. Imperative
Motion provides two fundamental approaches to creating animations: a declarative method centered around components for framework users, and an imperative method using a function for direct control. The choice between them depends on the project's context, the developer's preferred paradigm, and the specific animation requirements.

2.1 The Declarative Approach: The <motion/> Component
For developers working within React or Vue, the primary entry point to the Motion library is the <motion/> component. This is the cornerstone of the declarative API, providing a powerful and intuitive way to bring elements to life by describing their state rather than commanding their actions.   

A motion component is essentially a standard HTML or SVG element supercharged with animation capabilities. The library provides a version for every valid element, such as motion.div, motion.button, motion.svg, and motion.path, which can be used as direct replacements for their standard counterparts.   

Animations are driven through a set of special props. The most fundamental of these are initial, animate, and exit:

initial: Defines the state of the component before it enters the view. This can be an object of CSS properties or a reference to a variant.   
animate: Defines the state the component should animate to when it mounts or when the prop's value changes. This is the target state.   
exit: Defines the state the component should animate to before it is unmounted from the DOM. This requires the use of the <AnimatePresence> component.   
The core principle of this declarative approach is that animation is a function of state. A developer does not write code to handle the transition from state A to state B. Instead, they simply change the animate prop from A to B, and the <motion/> component handles the interpolation automatically. This aligns perfectly with the mental model of modern frontend frameworks like React and Vue, where the UI is a reflection of the application's state. This seamless integration is why it is the recommended approach for most framework users.javascript
// React Example: A simple fade-in and scale animation
import { motion } from "motion/react";   

function MyComponent() {
return (
<motion.div
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.5 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
/>
);
}


The `<motion/>` component can animate a wide range of values, including numbers, strings with units (`"100px"`, `"50vh"`), colors (Hex, RGBA, HSLA), and even complex strings like `box-shadow`.[11] It also offers enhanced `style` props for animating individual transforms (`x`, `y`, `rotate`, `scaleX`, etc.) independently, which provides enormous flexibility for gesture-based interactions.[11]

### 2.2 The Imperative Approach: The `animate()` Function

For developers working in vanilla JavaScript or those who require fine-grained, event-driven control within a framework, Motion provides the imperative `animate()` function. This function is the direct descendant of the original Motion One library and offers powerful, low-level control over animations.[9, 18]

The `animate()` function typically takes three arguments: a target element (or a CSS selector), a keyframes object defining the target values, and an options object for configuring the transition.[6, 9]

```javascript
// Vanilla JavaScript Example: Rotating a box
import { animate } from "motion";

animate(".box", { rotate: 360 }, { duration: 2, ease: "easeInOut" });
A key aspect of the imperative API is the availability of two distinct versions, allowing developers to make a conscious trade-off between features and bundle size :   

Mini Version (motion/mini): At just 2.3-2.6kb, this version is extremely lightweight. It relies entirely on the browser's native WAAPI for animations. It is ideal for high-performance animations of hardware-accelerated properties but lacks support for more advanced features like independent transforms, SVG path drawing, or complex sequences.   
Hybrid Version (default motion import): This full-featured version is around 18kb and includes the JavaScript animation engine. It unlocks the library's full potential, adding support for independent transforms, CSS variables, SVG path drawing (pathLength), complex animation sequences, and animating raw JavaScript objects (useful for WebGL).   
Unlike the declarative approach, calling animate() returns a set of animation controls, including methods like play(), pause(), stop(), and reverse(), as well as properties to get or set the current time and speed. This gives the developer complete manual control over the animation's playback lifecycle.   

For React developers, a common challenge is bridging the gap between React's declarative world and the need for imperative animation control. The useAnimate hook is the solution to this problem. It provides a scoped version of the animate() function that can be safely used inside useEffect hooks or event handlers. The hook returns a scope ref (which must be attached to a parent element) and the scoped animate function. Any selector passed to this function will only target elements within the scope, preventing unintended side effects. This hook is the official "escape hatch" for creating complex, multi-step, timeline-like sequences that are not easily expressed with variants or simple prop changes.   

JavaScript

// React Example: Using useAnimate for a sequence
import { useAnimate, useInView } from "motion/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyList() {
  const [scope, animate] = useAnimate();
  const isInView = useInView(scope, { once: true });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isInView) {
      // Create an imperative animation sequence
      const sequence = [".item-1", { x: 100 }, { duration: 0.5 }],
        [".item-2", { x: 100 }, { duration: 0.5, at: "-0.3" }], // Overlap with previous
        [".item-3", { x: 100 }, { duration: 0.5, at: "-0.3" }];
      animate(sequence);
    }
  }, [isInView, animate]);

  return (
    <ul ref={scope}>
      <li className="item-1">Item 1</li>
      <li className="item-2">Item 2</li>
      <li className="item-3">Item 3</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
Section 3: Mastering Transitions: The Physics of Movement
A transition defines the character of an animation—how it moves from its start state to its end state. Motion provides a sophisticated transition system that allows for a wide range of effects, from simple, timed tweens to complex, physics-based springs. Mastering these options is key to creating animations that feel intentional, natural, and responsive.

3.1 Transition Types
Motion offers three primary animation types, which can be specified using the type property in the transition prop (for declarative components) or the options object (for the imperative animate function).   

tween: This is a duration-based animation that moves between values over a specified time. It is the default type for non-physical properties like opacity and color. Its character is defined by a duration and an easing function, which controls the rate of change over time.   
spring: This animation type simulates the physics of a real-world spring. It's the default type for physical properties like x, y, scale, and rotate because it produces motion that feels natural and kinetic. Spring animations are inherently interruptible; if the target value changes mid-animation, the spring will smoothly retarget and animate towards the new value, often incorporating the existing velocity.   
inertia: This animation type is designed to decelerate a value based on its initial velocity. Its primary use case is for creating realistic "throwing" or inertial scrolling effects after a drag gesture. It is the default animation used for the dragTransition prop and can be configured with options like min, max, and modifyTarget to add boundaries or snap-to-grid functionality.   
3.2 Physics-Based vs. Duration-Based Springs: A Critical Distinction
Motion provides two distinct methods for configuring spring animations, each suited to different use cases. The choice between them represents a trade-off between physical realism and predictable choreography.

Physics-Based Springs: These springs are defined by physical properties that mirror a real-world mass-spring-damper system. They are configured using:

stiffness: The strength of the spring. Higher values result in tighter, faster movements (Default: 100).   
damping: The opposing force or friction that stops the spring's oscillation. A value of 0 results in an infinite oscillation (Default: 10).   
mass: The weight of the object being animated. Higher values create more sluggish, heavy-feeling motion (Default: 1).   
velocity: The initial velocity of the animation, allowing it to seamlessly take over from a user's gesture.   
The key characteristic of physics-based springs is that their duration is emergent—it is calculated by the physics engine based on these parameters. This makes them ideal for responsive UI where animations need to feel like a natural reaction to user input, such as an element springing back into place after being dragged.

Duration-Based Springs: For situations where an animation's timing must be precisely coordinated with other animations, a duration-based spring is more suitable. These are configured using:

duration: The time in seconds for the animation to run.   
bounce: A value from 0 (no bounce) to 1 (extremely bouncy) that controls the "bounciness" of the spring (Default: 0.25).   
A significant innovation for this type of spring is the visualDuration option. This property allows a developer to specify the time it takes for the animation to visually appear to reach its target. The "bouncy bit" of the animation will mostly occur after this duration has passed. This provides the best of both worlds: the aesthetic appeal of a spring with the predictable timing of a tween, making it much easier to choreograph complex sequences.   

The clear heuristic for developers is to use physics-based springs for gesture responses and direct manipulation, and to use duration-based springs (especially with visualDuration) for choreographed enter, exit, and state-change animations.

3.3 Easing Functions
For tween animations, easing functions determine the acceleration and deceleration of the animation over its duration. Motion provides a comprehensive set of built-in easing functions and supports custom definitions.   

Named Easings: A collection of standard easing curves are available by name:
"linear"
"easeIn", "easeOut", "easeInOut" (the default for single keyframe tweens is "easeOut")
"circIn", "circOut", "circInOut"
"backIn", "backOut", "backInOut"
"anticipate"
Custom Cubic Bézier: For complete control, a custom easing curve can be defined by passing an array of four numbers representing the P1 and P2 control points of a cubic-Bézier curve, for example, ease: [0.32, 0.23, 0.4, 0.9].   
Per-Keyframe Easing: When animating through multiple keyframes, the ease option can be an array of easing functions, with each function defining the transition between two keyframes.

Section 4: Orchestration and Sequencing
Beyond animating single elements, Motion provides powerful tools for orchestrating complex animation sequences across multiple components. These tools allow for the creation of intricate, choreographed user experiences, from staggered list entries to elaborate page transitions. The library offers both declarative and imperative methods for orchestration.

4.1 Variants: The Declarative Orchestration Engine
In React and Vue, variants are the primary mechanism for declarative animation orchestration. They are sets of named animation targets that can be defined once and reused throughout an application, promoting clean, maintainable code.   

A variants object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a custom name (e.g., "visible", "hidden", "hover") and each value is an animation target object (e.g., { opacity: 1, x: 0 }). This object is passed to a <motion/> component via the variants prop. Animations are then triggered by passing the variant's name as a string to props like initial, animate, or whileHover.   

JavaScript

// React Example: Defining and using variants
const listVariants = {
  visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { staggerChildren: 0.2 } },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
};

const itemVariants = {
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
};

function MyAnimatedList() {
  return (
    <motion.ul initial="hidden" animate="visible" variants={listVariants}>
      <motion.li variants={itemVariants} />
      <motion.li variants={itemVariants} />
      <motion.li variants={itemVariants} />
    </motion.ul>
  );
}
The true power of variants lies in propagation. When a parent motion component is instructed to animate to a specific variant (e.g., animate="visible"), that instruction automatically "flows down" to all of its motion children. Any child that has a variant defined with the same name ("visible") will also animate, without needing its own animate prop. This propagation is a form of implicit state management for animations and is the key to orchestrating complex UI sections with a single state change on a parent component.   

This implicit behavior is powerful but requires understanding to control effectively. The propagation of a variant down the component tree will stop at any child that defines its own animate prop. This rule provides the mechanism for overriding or halting the animation cascade, allowing for fine-grained control within a larger orchestrated sequence.   

4.2 Staggering Child Animations
Staggering animations—offsetting the start time for each element in a group—is a common technique for making list animations feel more dynamic and less robotic. Motion provides two ways to achieve this.

Declarative Staggering with Variants: When using variants, the transition property on a parent's variant can include staggerChildren. This property takes a number in seconds, which becomes the delay between the start of each child's animation. The staggerDirection property can be set to 1 (the default, for forward staggering) or -1 (for backward staggering).   

Imperative Staggering with stagger(): When using the imperative animate() function on multiple elements, the stagger() utility function can be passed to the delay option. This provides more granular control than the declarative approach, with options to define the startDelay, the origin point of the stagger (from: "first" | "center" | "last" | index), and an ease function. The ease option is a particularly powerful feature, as it allows for non-linear staggering. Instead of a constant delay between each item, the delay itself can be eased, creating more sophisticated and organic group animations.   

4.3 Exit Animations with AnimatePresence
One of the most celebrated features of Motion is its ability to animate components as they are removed from the React or Vue component tree, a task that is notoriously difficult to handle manually. This is achieved with the <AnimatePresence> component.   

To enable exit animations, components that are conditionally rendered must be wrapped in <AnimatePresence>. Crucially, each direct child of <AnimatePresence> must have a unique and stable key prop. This key is essential for the component to track which elements are entering, exiting, or remaining in the tree.   

When a keyed child is removed from the tree, <AnimatePresence> intercepts this removal. It keeps the component rendered in the DOM and triggers the animation defined in its exit prop. Once the exit animation is complete, <AnimatePresence> removes the element from the DOM. This mechanism effectively works by maintaining its own "virtual" representation of its children, allowing it to defer the actual DOM removal until the animation has finished, a clever solution to a limitation in React's own lifecycle.   

The mode prop on <AnimatePresence> controls how it handles simultaneous enter and exit animations:

"sync" (Default): Entering and exiting elements animate at the same time.
"wait": The new, entering element will wait until the old, exiting element has finished its animation before it begins to animate in. This is useful for content swaps where only one element should be visible at a time.   
"popLayout": The exiting element is immediately given position: "absolute", removing it from the document's layout flow. This allows surrounding elements to instantly animate to their new positions without waiting for the exit animation to complete.   
4.4 Imperative Timelines with animate() sequences
For vanilla JavaScript projects or for highly complex, choreographed sequences within a framework, Motion's imperative API supports timeline creation. Unlike libraries with a dedicated timeline() constructor, Motion integrates this functionality directly into the animate() function.   

A timeline is created by passing an array of animation definitions (a sequence) to animate(). Each definition in the sequence is an array with the format [target, keyframes, options].   

The timing of each segment in the sequence can be precisely controlled with the at option:

Absolute Time: at: 1.5 will start the segment exactly 1.5 seconds into the timeline.
Relative Time: at: "<" starts the segment at the same time as the previous one. at: "+0.5" starts it 0.5 seconds after the previous one has finished.
Labeled Time: You can create a label with at: "myLabel" and then start other animations relative to that label, for example, at: "myLabel" or at: "myLabel + 0.2".   
This sequence-based approach provides powerful, low-level control for building intricate, multi-part animations that are not tied to the declarative lifecycle of components.

Section 5: Interactive Animations: Responding to User Gestures
Motion provides a rich and powerful gesture recognition system that extends the basic event listeners of React and Vue. This system makes it simple to create fluid, interactive animations that respond to user input like hovering, tapping, and dragging. The gesture system is designed to provide a better user experience than traditional CSS or JavaScript events, with built-in features like pointer filtering and enhanced accessibility.   

5.1 Gesture-based Animation Props
The simplest way to add interactive animations is through the while- props on a <motion/> component. These props define an animation target or a variant name to animate to while a specific gesture is active. When the gesture ends, the component automatically animates back to its state as defined by the animate prop.   

whileHover: Triggers when a pointer hovers over the component. Motion intelligently filters out "fake" hover events that can be fired by touch inputs on some browsers, ensuring this only responds to actual mouse movements.   
whileTap: Triggers when a user presses down on the component with a primary pointer (left-click or first touch). It also filters out secondary pointers like right-clicks.   
whileFocus: Triggers when an element receives focus, following the same rules as the CSS :focus-visible selector. This is typically used for inputs or elements focused via keyboard navigation, enhancing accessibility.   
whileDrag: Triggers while an element with the drag prop is being actively dragged by the user.   
5.2 Event Listeners
For more complex interactions, Motion provides a set of event listener props that correspond to the gesture lifecycle. These callbacks receive the native browser event and, for pointer events, a pointInfo object with detailed coordinates and velocity.

Hover: onHoverStart(event) and onHoverEnd(event).   
Tap: onTapStart(event, info), onTap(event, info), and onTapCancel(event, info). The onTap event only fires if the pointer is released over the same component where it was pressed down.   
Drag: onDragStart, onDrag, and onDragEnd. These provide continuous updates during a drag gesture.
Pan: onPan(event, info). The pan gesture is recognized when a pointer presses down and moves more than a 3-pixel threshold. It is useful for creating custom draggable interfaces, like sliders, without applying the transform directly to the element. Note that for pan to work correctly with touch input, the element must have the touch-action CSS property set to disable native browser scrolling on the relevant axis.   
5.3 Advanced Drag Functionality
The drag prop enables dragging on an element. It can be set to true (for both axes), "x", or "y". Motion's drag gesture comes with several advanced configuration options:

Constraints: The dragConstraints prop can be used to limit the draggable area. It can be an object with top, left, right, and bottom pixel values, or it can be a React ref to another element, which will act as the bounding box.   
Elasticity: When dragging past the defined constraints, the element will "tug" with some resistance. This can be controlled with the dragElastic prop, a value between 0 (no elasticity, a hard stop) and 1 (full motion outside constraints).   
Direction Locking: By setting dragDirectionLock to true, the element's drag axis will be locked to the first direction of movement (either horizontal or vertical) for the duration of that specific drag gesture.   
Momentum: By default, when a drag gesture ends, the element will continue to move with an inertia animation based on the release velocity. This can be disabled by setting dragMomentum={false}.   
5.4 Accessibility of Gestures
Motion's gesture system is designed with accessibility in mind. A key feature is that any element with a whileTap or onTap prop automatically becomes keyboard-accessible. It will be added to the tab order and can be "tapped" using the Enter key. The lifecycle maps directly to keyboard events:

Pressing Enter down triggers onTapStart and the whileTap animation.
Releasing Enter triggers the onTap event.
If the element loses focus before Enter is released, onTapCancel is fired.   
This ensures that users who rely on keyboard navigation have an equivalent experience to pointer users, without requiring extra developer effort.

Section 6: Advanced Layout Animations
Motion features an industry-leading layout animation engine that simplifies one of the most complex challenges in web animation: smoothly transitioning elements between different sizes and positions. This system is more advanced than traditional "FLIP" (First, Last, Invert, Play) techniques, as it automatically corrects for scale-induced distortions on properties like borderRadius and boxShadow down through nested element trees.   

6.1 The layout Prop
The cornerstone of this system is the layout prop. By simply adding layout to a <motion/> component, it is instructed to automatically detect and animate any changes to its size or position that occur as a result of a React re-render.   

JavaScript

// React Example: Animating justify-content
const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

return (
  <div 
    className="switch" 
    onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}
    style={{ justifyContent: isOn? "flex-end" : "flex-start" }}
  >
    <motion.div className="handle" layout transition={{ type: "spring" }} />
  </div>
);
In this example, toggling the isOn state changes the justify-content property of the parent div. The child <motion.div> with the layout prop will automatically animate its position from one side to the other. This makes previously unanimatable CSS properties, such as justify-content, flex-direction, or grid properties, effectively animatable. For this to work, layout-affecting CSS changes should be applied directly via the style prop, not the animate prop, as layout is responsible for creating the animation.   

6.2 Shared Layout Transitions with layoutId
To create "magic motion" effects where an animation appears to flow between two completely separate components, the layoutId prop is used. When a component with a layoutId mounts, and another component with the same layoutId is unmounting (or has just unmounted), Motion will automatically animate the new component from the position and size of the old one.   

This is commonly used for effects like a thumbnail expanding into a modal, or an underline indicator moving between tabs. When using layoutId for exit animations, the components must be wrapped in <AnimatePresence>.   

6.3 LayoutGroup: Coordinating Animations
By default, a component with a layout prop only measures its own layout on re-render to optimize performance. However, in complex UIs like an accordion, one component's layout change (e.g., expanding) affects the position of its siblings, even if those siblings don't re-render themselves.

The <LayoutGroup> component solves this problem. By wrapping a set of related components in <LayoutGroup>, you tell Motion that they are part of a single layout system. When any component within the group re-renders and its layout changes, layout animations will be triggered across all other components in the group that are affected, ensuring they all move to their new positions in a coordinated fashion.   

Furthermore, layoutId is global across an entire application. If you have multiple independent sets of components that use the same layoutId (e.g., multiple tab sets on one page, each with an "underline" indicator), you must namespace them to prevent them from animating between each other. This is done by wrapping each set in a <LayoutGroup> and providing a unique id prop to each group.   

6.4 The Reorder Components
For the specific use case of creating drag-to-reorder lists, Motion provides a set of specialized helper components: Reorder.Group and Reorder.Item. These components are lightweight wrappers around <motion/> components that handle the complex logic of tracking item order and triggering layout animations.   

Reorder.Group: This component wraps the entire list. It must be passed the array of items via the values prop and a callback function to onReorder that updates the state with the new item order. It defaults to rendering a <ul> but can be changed with the as prop. The axis prop ("x" or "y") specifies the direction of reordering.   
Reorder.Item: This component is used for each item in the list. It must be passed a unique key and a value from the values array.   
Reorder.Item components are pre-configured with the layout prop, so when the list is reordered, or when items are added or removed, the other items will automatically animate to their new positions. For advanced use cases like custom drag handles or reordering within a scrollable container, the documentation provides guidance on using useDragControls and the layoutScroll prop.   

6.5 Comparison with Native View Transitions API
Modern browsers are beginning to implement the native View Transitions API, which also aims to solve the problem of animating between different DOM states. While the native API is promising and very cheap to implement for simple crossfades, Motion's layout animations offer several key advantages in their current state :   

Interruptibility: Motion's layout animations are visually interruptible. If a new animation is triggered mid-transition, it will smoothly blend from the current state. The native API can feel "janky" as it will often snap to the end of the current animation before starting the next one.
Interaction: Motion animations do not block pointer events, whereas the native API overlays snapshot images that can make the UI feel "sticky" and unresponsive during a transition.
Performance: Motion animates layout using the highly performant CSS transform property. The native API works by taking image snapshots of the old and new states and animating their width and height, which is measurably less performant, especially when animating many elements.
Flexibility: Motion's system handles relative animations (e.g., a delayed child within an animating parent) and correctly accounts for page scroll changes during transitions, which are areas where the native API currently has drawbacks.
Section 7: Scroll-Driven Animations
Motion provides a comprehensive suite of tools for creating animations that are linked to or triggered by the user's scroll position. This enables a wide range of popular web effects, from simple fade-in-on-scroll elements to complex parallax scenes and scroll-linked progress indicators. The library distinguishes between two primary paradigms of scroll animation.   

7.1 Scroll-Triggered vs. Scroll-Linked Animations
Scroll-Triggered Animations: These are standard, time-based animations (like a tween or spring) that are started when an element enters the browser's viewport. Once triggered, the animation runs to completion on its own, independent of further scrolling.   
Scroll-Linked Animations: In this paradigm, an animation's progress is directly and continuously tied to the scroll position. For example, as the user scrolls from the top to the bottom of the page, an animated value might progress from 0 to 1. The animation plays forwards and backward as the user scrolls up and down.   
7.2 Scroll-Triggered Animations
The primary tools for creating scroll-triggered animations are the whileInView prop for declarative components and the inView() function or useInView hook for more granular control.

whileInView Prop (React/Vue): This is the simplest method. By adding the whileInView prop to a <motion/> component, you define an animation target that the component will animate to as soon as it enters the viewport.   

JavaScript

// Element fades in when it scrolls into view
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.5 }} // Options to configure the trigger
/>
The viewport prop can be used to configure the trigger behavior, such as setting once: true to prevent the animation from re-running, or amount to define how much of the element must be visible before the animation triggers.   

inView() and useInView: For more advanced use cases or for triggering animations on non-motion elements, Motion provides helper functions.

inView() (Vanilla JS): This 0.5kb function uses the browser's native IntersectionObserver API for optimal performance. It takes a selector or element and a callback function that fires when the element enters the viewport. It can also return a cleanup function that fires when the element leaves.   
useInView (React): This 0.6kb hook returns a boolean state (true or false) indicating if the referenced element is currently in the viewport. This state can then be used in a useEffect to trigger any kind of logic, including imperative animations with useAnimate.   
7.3 Scroll-Linked Animations
Scroll-linked animations are powered by Motion's ability to track scroll progress as a MotionValue—a reactive value between 0 and 1.

scroll() Function (Vanilla JS): This 5.1kb function is the core imperative API for scroll-linked animations. It can accept a callback that receives the latest scroll progress, or it can be passed an animation created with animate() to link its playback directly to the scrollbar. It can track the window scroll or the scroll of a specific container element. Critically, it takes advantage of Motion's hybrid engine, using the native ScrollTimeline API where available for hardware-accelerated performance.   

useScroll Hook (React): This hook is the primary tool for scroll-linked animations in React. It returns four MotionValues :   

scrollX / scrollY: The absolute scroll offset in pixels.
scrollXProgress / scrollYProgress: The scroll progress as a value between 0 and 1.
These MotionValues can be passed directly to a <motion/> component's style prop to create effects like a page scroll progress bar.   

JavaScript

// React Example: Page scroll progress bar
import { motion, useScroll } from "motion/react";

function ProgressBar() {
  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll();
  return <motion.div className="progress-bar" style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress }} />;
}
7.4 Advanced Scroll Effects with useTransform and useSpring
The true power of useScroll is realized when its output MotionValues are composed with other hooks.

useTransform: This hook can map the scrollYProgress value (0 to 1) to a different output range. This is the key to creating parallax effects, color transitions, and other complex scroll-linked visuals.
JavaScript

// React Example: Parallax effect
const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ target: ref });
const y = useTransform(scrollYProgress, , ["-10%", "10%"]);
return <motion.div ref={ref} style={{ y }} />;
  
useSpring: The raw output of useScroll can sometimes feel rigid. By passing the progress MotionValue through the useSpring hook, the scroll-linked animation can be smoothed out, adding a natural-feeling "lag" or damping to the movement.   
By combining useScroll, useTransform, and useSpring, developers can create a vast array of sophisticated, performant, and physically plausible scroll-driven animations.

Section 8: The Reactive Core: A Deep Dive into Motion Values and Hooks (React)
At the heart of Motion's React implementation is a powerful reactive system built around Motion Values. These are special objects that track the state and velocity of a single animated value (like a number or color). Their key advantage is that they can be updated and passed to the style prop of motion components to drive animations without triggering a React re-render. This is a critical performance optimization, as it bypasses the potentially expensive React render cycle for every frame of an animation.   

While motion components create and manage Motion Values internally, a suite of React hooks allows developers to create and compose them manually for advanced use cases.

8.1 MotionValue: The Core Primitive
A MotionValue is created using the useMotionValue hook. It can be manipulated with methods like .set(value), .get(), and .getVelocity(). It can also be subscribed to using the .on("change", callback) method or, more conveniently, the useMotionValueEvent hook.   

8.2 Core Hooks
useMotionValue(initialValue): Creates and returns a new MotionValue initialized with the provided value.   
useMotionValueEvent(value, eventName, callback): A convenience hook for subscribing to events on a MotionValue within a React component. It handles the subscription and cleanup logic automatically. Available events are "change", "animationStart", "animationComplete", and "animationCancel".   
8.3 Transformative Hooks
These hooks create new MotionValues by transforming or composing others.

useTransform(value, inputRange, outputRange, options?): Maps an input MotionValue from an input range to an output range. For example, it can map a scrollYProgress value from to an `opacity` value of. It is the cornerstone of many advanced effects.   
useSpring(value, config?): Creates a new MotionValue that follows another MotionValue with a spring animation. This is used to add smoothing or "lag" to a value, for instance, to make a scroll-linked animation less rigid.   
useVelocity(value): Creates a MotionValue that reports the velocity (rate of change per second) of the source MotionValue.   
useTime(): Returns a MotionValue that continuously updates with the elapsed time since it was created, in milliseconds. This is useful for creating perpetual animations, like an infinite rotation, by transforming the time value.   
8.4 Utility Hooks
These hooks provide utilities for controlling animations and responding to component state.

useAnimate(): The bridge to the imperative animate() API. Returns a [scope, animate] tuple for creating complex, scoped animation sequences inside event handlers or useEffect.   
useInView(ref, options?): Tracks whether an element is within the viewport, returning a boolean. Useful for triggering animations on scroll.   
usePresence(): Used within children of <AnimatePresence> to manually control exit animations. Returns ``, where safeToRemove is a function that must be called to unmount the component after its exit animation is complete.   
useDragControls(): Creates a set of controls that can be used to manually initiate a drag gesture from an element other than the draggable one itself.   
useReducedMotion(): Returns true if the user has enabled the "Reduced Motion" setting in their operating system, allowing for the creation of accessible animations.   
Table 8.1: React Hooks API Reference

Section 9: Framework-Specific Implementations
While Motion offers a core set of animation primitives that are framework-agnostic, its true power and developer experience shine through its tailored integrations with modern frontend libraries. The library provides official support for React and Vue, with strong community support for other ecosystems like Svelte and SolidJS.

9.1 Motion for Vue
Motion for Vue provides a feature-complete port of the declarative API, bringing the power of <motion/> components and AnimatePresence to the Vue ecosystem. The API is designed to feel native to Vue developers.   

Installation and Setup: The library is installed via npm install motion-v. It offers official Nuxt module support (motion-v/nuxt), which handles auto-importing of most components. For standard Vite projects, it can integrate with unplugin-vue-components for a similar auto-import experience.   
The <motion> Component: Similar to the React version, this is the core of the library. Props are bound using Vue's standard syntax, for example, :animate="{ rotate: 360 }".   
Gestures: The component extends Vue's event system with recognizers for hover, press, focus, and drag. The prop names are slightly different to align with Vue conventions, for instance, :whilePress instead of whileTap, and event handlers use the @ syntax, like @hoverStart.   
Hooks and Composables: Vue's Composition API is supported with composables like useScroll and useSpring, which function similarly to their React Hook counterparts, returning reactive refs or MotionValues that can be used in component styles.   
AnimatePresence: The component works with Vue's native conditional rendering (v-if, v-show) and list rendering (v-for) to enable exit animations, requiring a unique :key on each child as in React.   
9.2 Motion for Vanilla JavaScript
For projects that do not use a declarative JavaScript framework, or for integrations with tools like Webflow or WordPress, Motion's imperative API is the intended solution. This API surface is the direct legacy of the original Motion One library.   

Core Functions: The primary functions are animate(), scroll(), inView(), and stagger(). These provide a complete toolkit for creating single animations, scroll-linked effects, scroll-triggered events, and staggered sequences.   
Installation: Motion can be installed via a package manager (npm install motion) or loaded directly in an HTML page via a <script> tag from a CDN like JSDelivr. This script tag approach is particularly useful for no-code platforms.   
Performance Focus: The vanilla JS API gives developers direct access to the "mini" version of animate by importing from motion/mini. This provides the smallest possible bundle size for simple, hardware-accelerated animations.   
9.3 Community Integrations: Svelte and SolidJS
While official support is focused on React and Vue, the core Motion One engine is highly adaptable, and dedicated community libraries have emerged to bring a similar declarative experience to other frameworks.

SolidJS (solid-motionone): This community package provides a declarative wrapper around Motion One for SolidJS applications. It offers a <Motion> component that mirrors the API of its React/Vue counterparts, with props like animate, transition, initial, and exit. It leverages Solid's fine-grained reactivity, allowing Solid signals to be passed directly into animation props to drive updates. It also includes a <Presence> component for handling exit animations with Solid's <Show> component.   
Svelte (svelte-motion): svelte-motion is a community-led port of Framer Motion's concepts to Svelte. It provides a <M> component (e.g., <M.div>) and a set of hooks like useMotionValue and useTransform that are adapted to Svelte's reactivity model. It's important to note that, as of late 2024, this project appears to be less actively maintained than the official Motion libraries. Svelte also has its own built-in motion module (svelte/motion) with tweened and spring functions, which provide a different, store-based approach to animation. Developers using Svelte must choose between the native Svelte tools, the imperative Motion One API, or the community svelte-motion library.   
Section 10: Advanced Topics and Specialized Animations
Beyond standard DOM animations, Motion provides specialized APIs for tackling more complex and visually rich challenges, including SVG manipulation, 3D rendering with React Three Fiber, and ensuring compatibility with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) frameworks.

10.1 SVG Animations
Motion offers first-class support for animating SVG elements, enabling effects like path drawing and morphing.

Path Drawing: The hybrid animate function and the declarative <motion.path> component can animate three special properties on most SVG elements (<path>, <circle>, <rect>, etc.) to create line-drawing effects :   

pathLength: A progress value from 0 to 1. Animating this value from 0 to 1 makes the path appear to draw itself.
pathSpacing: A value from 0 to 1 that controls the spacing of dashes in the path.
pathOffset: A value from 0 to 1 that controls the starting offset of the path, useful for creating "marching ants" effects.
Path Morphing: Animating the d attribute of an SVG <path> element to smoothly transition between two different shapes is a complex problem. Motion facilitates this by allowing for integration with the Flubber library. Using the useTransform hook, a developer can provide a custom mixer function that uses Flubber's interpolate method. This tells Motion to use Flubber to calculate the intermediate path shapes during the animation, resulting in seamless and fluid morphs between complex vectors.   

SVG Layout Animations: It is important to note that SVG elements are not currently supported by Motion's layout animation system. SVGs do not have a browser-native layout system like HTML elements (e.g., Flexbox, Grid). Therefore, to animate changes in an SVG's position or size, developers should directly animate its attributes like x, y, width, height, or cx.   

10.2 3D Animations
For developers working with 3D on the web, Motion provides a dedicated library, framer-motion-3d, which integrates with the popular React Three Fiber (R3F) ecosystem. This library is deprecated but still documented.   

motion 3D Components: The library provides motion equivalents for R3F primitives (e.g., <motion.mesh>, <motion.pointLight>). These components accept the same animation props as their 2D counterparts, including animate, variants, and gesture props like whileHover.   
Supported Values: Animations are supported for 3D transforms (x, y, z, scaleX/Y/Z, rotateX/Y/Z) as well as material properties like color and opacity on primitives that support them.   
Hooks and Motion Values: The same hooks from the 2D library, such as useMotionValue, useTransform, and useSpring, can be used to create and compose reactive values for driving 3D animations outside of the React render loop.   
Layout Animations in 3D: To correctly handle perspective and scale distortion when a 3D scene is part of a 2D layout animation, the library provides LayoutCamera and LayoutOrthographicCamera components. These specialized cameras sync with the layout animation system to ensure the 3D scene appears correctly integrated.   
10.3 Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Using Motion with server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js requires some specific considerations, particularly with the advent of React Server Components (RSC).

Client Components: Motion is a client-side library. It uses hooks like useEffect and directly manipulates the DOM, which are operations that can only run in the browser. Therefore, any React component that uses Motion components or hooks must be designated as a Client Component by placing the "use client"; directive at the top of the file.   
SSR and Hydration: Designating a component as a Client Component does not mean it is not server-rendered. In Next.js, Client Components are still pre-rendered into static HTML on the server. This HTML is sent to the browser for a fast initial paint. Then, the client-side JavaScript loads and "hydrates" the static HTML, attaching the event listeners and animation logic. This ensures that content is visible and SEO-friendly even before the interactive animations are ready.   
Best Practice: The recommended approach is to create small, dedicated "wrapper" components for your animations. These wrappers will contain the "use client"; directive and all the Motion logic, and they can then be imported and used within larger Server Components. This strategy allows you to keep the bulk of your application as Server Components, minimizing the amount of client-side JavaScript that needs to be shipped to the browser.   
Section 11: Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices
Creating beautiful animations is only half the battle; ensuring they are performant, accessible to all users, and built upon a solid foundation of best practices is what separates professional UI engineering from simple decoration. Motion provides the tools and architectural advantages to excel in these areas.

11.1 Performance Optimization
Motion is architected for performance, but developers can further optimize their implementations by following key principles.

Leverage Hardware Acceleration: As detailed in Section 1.3, Motion's hybrid engine automatically uses hardware acceleration for transform, opacity, and filter animations whenever possible. Developers should prioritize animating these properties over layout-inducing properties like width, height, margin, or top/left for maximal performance. For layout changes, the layout prop should be used, as it performs animations using only transforms.   
Mind the Bundle Size: For projects where bundle size is critical, developers should consciously choose the most efficient API. Using the imperative animate() function from the motion/mini entry point provides the smallest possible footprint (2.6kb) for basic animations. Features like spring or stagger can be imported on-demand, adding only what is necessary.   
Animate Outside the Render Loop: In React, using Motion Values with hooks like useMotionValue and useTransform is crucial for performance. These allow animation values to be updated and rendered directly to the DOM without triggering costly React re-renders on every frame.   
The will-change Property: For animations that might be complex or stutter on lower-end devices, developers can provide a hint to the browser that a property is about to be animated. In React, this can be done with the willChange prop on a motion component. This encourages the browser to move the element to its own compositor layer in preparation for the animation, which can prevent flickering or tearing. However, this should be used sparingly, as over-optimizing can sometimes lead to increased memory usage.   
11.2 Accessibility (a11y)
Thoughtful motion design enhances user experience, but gratuitous or poorly implemented motion can be distracting and may even cause physical discomfort for users with vestibular disorders or photosensitive epilepsy. Motion provides robust tools for creating accessible animations that respect user preferences.   

The core mechanism for this is the prefers-reduced-motion CSS media query. Modern operating systems allow users to enable a "Reduce Motion" setting, and this query allows websites to detect that preference. Best practices for reduced motion include :   

Disabling or replacing large-scale transform animations (like sliding panels) with more subtle opacity fades.
Disabling auto-playing videos and looping animations.
Disabling parallax and other scroll-jacking effects.
Ensuring animations do not flash more than three times per second.
Motion offers two primary ways to implement these practices in React:

MotionConfig: The <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"> component can be wrapped around an entire application. When the user has "Reduce Motion" enabled, this will automatically disable all transform and layout animations on child motion components, while preserving animations on other properties like opacity and color. This is an excellent "blanket" solution for ensuring a baseline of accessibility.   
useReducedMotion Hook: For more granular control, this hook returns a boolean indicating if the user prefers reduced motion. This boolean can be used to conditionally apply different animation variants or disable specific effects, such as parallax scrolling or video autoplay.   
11.3 Comparative Analysis: Motion vs. GSAP
When choosing an animation library, developers often compare Motion to GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). While both are powerful, they have fundamental differences in philosophy, architecture, and licensing.   

Licensing and Source: Motion is fully independent and MIT open-source, supported by industry sponsors and sales of its premium "Motion+" examples. GSAP is a closed-source, commercial product with a more restrictive license, though it offers a free tier.   
Engine: Motion uses its unique hybrid engine, leveraging native WAAPI for hardware acceleration where possible. GSAP runs animations purely on a JavaScript requestAnimationFrame loop. This means Motion can offer smoother animations when the main thread is busy, a key performance differentiator.   
Bundle Size: Motion is generally smaller. The mini animate() is 2.6kb, and the full hybrid version is 18kb. GSAP's core is around 23kb, and it does not support tree-shaking, meaning the entire library is imported even if only one feature is used. Motion is fully tree-shakable.   
API and Features: Both libraries offer rich feature sets including keyframes, timelines, and path animation. However, some advanced GSAP features, like inertia or path morphing plugins, require a paid license, whereas these are available in the open-source version of Motion (with path morphing requiring the external Flubber library). GSAP has more advanced timeline and staggering features, like grid-based staggering, which Motion does not currently have.

Conclusion
The Motion library represents a sophisticated and mature ecosystem for web animation, successfully unifying the developer-centric, declarative approach of Framer Motion with the performance-oriented, imperative core of Motion One. Its defining feature is a pragmatic hybrid engine that leverages the performance of native browser APIs (WAAPI, ScrollTimeline) while using a JavaScript fallback to ensure a complete and consistent feature set across all modern browsers.

For developers, the choice of which API to use within the library—the declarative <motion/> components or the imperative animate() function—is a conscious trade-off between developer experience and bundle-size optimization. The declarative API, with its initial, animate, and exit props, integrates seamlessly into the state-driven architecture of React and Vue, making it the ideal choice for the majority of UI development tasks. For more complex, choreographed sequences or for use in framework-agnostic projects, the imperative API provides granular control over timelines and playback.

The library's power is further extended through its advanced features. The layout animation system, centered on the layout prop and LayoutGroup component, makes traditionally difficult transitions trivial. The scroll animation suite, powered by the useScroll hook and native ScrollTimeline, enables performant and complex scroll-driven effects. Finally, a deep commitment to accessibility is evident in the useReducedMotion hook and MotionConfig component, empowering developers to build inclusive experiences that respect user preferences.

By understanding the library's history, its dual philosophies, and its core architectural principles, developers can effectively harness the full spectrum of tools offered by Motion to create animations that are not only visually stunning but also performant, maintainable, and accessible.
